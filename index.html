            </div>
            <div class="six columns">
              <p class="justify">It all began when a deadly influenza epidemic, known as the Spanish Flu, swept across the entire country, including Qellem and its vicinity in 1918-1919. This made it absolutely urgent to invite Dr. Thomas Alexander Lambie, a medical missionary of the American Presbyterian Mission (United Presbyterian Church of North America – UPCNA) stationed at Nasser, Sudan, to come and provide the sorely needed medical service. The invitation was from the governor of Qellem, sub-province of Wallaga, Birru Wolde-Gabriel. Lambie immediately informed the Board of Foreign Missions about the invitation to which the Board favorably responded.</p>
              <p class="justify"><br>
              In response to this urgent invitation Lambie arrived in Sayo, Dambi Dollo in July 1919. As the news of Lambie’s arrival spread, patients began to come for treatment. To meet the need of the people, a temporary clinic was set up in a corner of the veranda of a coffee warehouse owned by a Greek coffee merchant, Kramvis, until land was acquired and suitable clinic was built. That was how the Dembi Dollo Hospital began. Eighty hectares of land, tax free, was given to Lambie for Mission work. The grant was signed and sealed by Birru on December 25, 1919 and later approved by Ras Teferi. The first clinic was built of stone and straw thatched roof. This served for a few years and a better one was built and served until still a much better one was built in 1933. In 1930 the First Church, N.S. Pittsburgh, gave $12,000 for the erection of a memorial to their pastor’s wife, Jean R. Orr.<br>
              <br>
              It was with this money that a very modern hospital was built, equipped and completed in 1933. The hospital was named “The Jean R. Orr Memorial Hospital” in memory of Jean R. Orr in whose name the money was collected.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="six columns">
              <p class="justify">The development continued and during the 1960s this hospital was completely renovated and extended with additional buildings. A Dresser school was added and a number of young men and women were trained here.</p>
              <p class="justify">The hospital became famous and attracted people from far and wide. It was known as one of the best hospitals in the country and served the Mengistu’s Communist Government (1974-1991) expropriated it and expelled the missionary medical personnel. The government took over and the hospital lost all its credibility and went down the drain. Its deterioration is beyond words can express. The name was also changed to “Dembi Dollo Hospital” and continued its service under Ministry of Health.<br>
              <br>
              The hospital came to the attention of “Glimmer of Hope Foundation”, a US based organization, which contributed a lot to renovate the buildings and revived the fame of the hospital although it is not yet what it ought to be and to do. These days many people, including former missionaries and their offspring are determined to bring the hospital to its former glory. Interested individuals and organizations are fervently invited to participate in this historic and noble undertaking to make this hospital what it ought to be and to do.</p>
